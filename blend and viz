##table for what the final score is for each team in each game. Grouping by posteam is important to be sure each team gets their mirrored point differentials.
##The slice(n()) function gives us the final record of each grouping, in this case, sorted by game seconds remaining.
final_score <- past_five %>%
  filter(posteam != "NA") %>%
  group_by(posteam, game_id) %>%
  slice(n()) %>%

##table for cumulative epa. leave out null posteam plays, then sum the epa. simple enough
final_epa <- past_five %>%
  filter(posteam != "NA") %>%
  group_by(posteam, game_id) %>%
  summarise(cumulative_epa = sum(epa, na.rm = TRUE))

##join together
tbl <- inner_join(final_score,final_epa, by = c("posteam","game_id"))

##create a quick linear model with our two fields of interest
lm <- lm(score_differential_post ~ cumulative_epa, data=tbl)

##find the r squared of the linear model
summary(lm)$r.squared
